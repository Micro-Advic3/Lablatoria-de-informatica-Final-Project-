# Laboratório de Informática Final Project

## Project Overview

This project is a "Restaurant Web Application" developed for the Laboratório de Informática course. It provides an interactive platform where users can browse menus, register, manage a shopping cart, and view detailed information about food items.

## Features

- **Home Page (`index.html`):**
  - Introduction to the restaurant.
  - Navigation bar linking to various sections.
  - Featured menu items with options to view the full menu.

- **Menu Page (`menu.html`):**
  - Displays food categories (e.g., Sandwiches, Pizza, Kebab).
  - Includes product details like name, description, images, and prices.

- **Registration Page (`register.html`):**
  - User registration form with fields for name, family name, and phone number.
  - Form validation to ensure accurate data entry.

- **Shopping Cart Page (`shop-cart.html`):**
  - Lists selected items with prices and quantity adjustments.
  - Calculates total price and allows item removal.

- **Food Details Page (`food_details.html`):**
  - Provides detailed information about specific food items, including nutritional facts.
  - Features a dynamic image gallery related to the product.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3/SCSS
